        [2025.8] Released the SOTA CoT-PRM model ([VRPRM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03556)), achieving Test-time Scaling effect of Best-of-N approaching the theoretical limit value Pass@K, surpassing the SOTA model by 118% with only 1/8 of traning data.

        [2025.8] A unified model [NaviMaster](https://iron-boyy.github.io/navimaster/) has been released that can operate both the digital GUI interface and real-world navigation simultaneously.

        [2025.8] As the sole corresponding author, he directed the internship student to submit a paper, which was published in EMNLP2025 Oral. The main research focuses on the impact of "Uncertainty" on the reasoning RL training process.

        [2025.7] [As Core Lead, responsible for knowledge enhancement of SafeWork-R1 and "Deliberation Mode" related modules, the relevant results are published at WAIC2025.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18576)

        [2025.6] As the corresponding author, he guided the internship student to submit a paper, which was included in ICCV 2025. The relevant achievements have refreshed the SOTA of multi-modal retrieval, and it can provide the function of precise memory retrieval for embodied AI with 500,000 frames.[demo](https://bwliu01.github.io/IDMR/)

        [2025.5] [A comprehensive review article on AI tracing was published in Artificial Intelligence Review, spanning 60 pages and comprising 20,000 words.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-025-11222-w)

        [2024.10] Join Safety and Trustworthy AI Center in the Shanghai AI Laboratory, responsible for knowledge enhancement for LLMs.

        [2023.10] First author paper, [using a dynamic graph network evolution engine for accelerated simulation of complex transportation systems].(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10422572/)ã€‚

        [2022.10] Join Shanghai AI Laboratory, mainly responsible for  AI security evaluation systems and multi-agent simulation platforms. I earned an 'Excellent' performance rating for two consecutive years.

        [2022.11] [A paper is included in the 1st Learning on Graphs Conference, mainly studying the evolution issue of dynamic graphs.](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v198/wang22c.html)

        [2022.3] [Collaborative paper published in Nature Machine Intelligence.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00459-7)

        [2021.9] [The first author's graph computing paper has been published in SIGMOD 2021 Oral, which is the result of an internship at Ant Group.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3448016.3457564)
